# Decentralized Exchange
- Project is a simple version of decentralized exchange, concept is to store all orders in dex (high gas, yes :( )
- Algorithms and datastructure for order book are also naive, for learning purposes only
- Front End is done in React (16+)
- Project is very much inspired from the course I study: https://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/p/6-figure-blockchain-developer
